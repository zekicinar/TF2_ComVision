# TF2_ComVision

This repo contains basic examples about computer vision projects. I studied  'TensorFlow 2.0 Computer Vision Cookbook'(ISBN 978-1-83882-913-1) and these are my notes to remember subjects. The original codes are available at https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Tensorflow-2.0-Computer-Vision-Cookbook. 
Notebooks have lots of comment lines to explain every steps
